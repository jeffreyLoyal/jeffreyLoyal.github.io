        <p>Below are some of the projects I have worked on through internships, coursework, and personal initiatives.</p>

            <p><strong>🔗 Link:</strong> <a href="https://jeffreyhoyle.com" target="_blank">jeffreyhoyle.com</a></p>
            <p>In my **sophomore year of high school**, I built <strong>JeffreyHoyle.com</strong>, a website dedicated to my <strong>goalkeeping highlights</strong> as I was actively being recruited for college soccer. This project served as my introduction to <strong>web design</strong> and <strong>personal branding</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Through this experience, I:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learned how to <strong>design and structure websites</strong> using <strong>WordPress</strong> as my main platform.</li>
                <li>Gained hands-on experience in <strong>content management, SEO, and digital marketing</strong> to grow engagement.</li>
                <li>Developed a passion for <strong>business, marketing, and web development</strong>, which influenced my career direction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project not only showcased my athletic career but also gave me <strong>technical skills</strong> in web development and online engagement.</p>
